In this section, we will identify and assess our requirements as well as to conduct a needs assessment.



## Requirements  

#### Functional Requirements:  
- The player can move the spaceship
- The player can fight enemies likewise, vice versa..
- There is a bossfight in the level
- An in-game Scene is used to choose and start a new mission
- Enemies are smart enough to keep the game interesting and challenging 
- The player can use in-game abilities to influence the gameplay 
- The player can customize the game settings to their liking

#### Non-Functional Requirements:  
- Performance - In order to ensure smooth lagging-free performance on all computers, the game must be optimized
- Scalability - Software Architecture must be designed in such a way that the game can be expanded later on 
- Reliability - The game should not crash or present any issues that cause it to malfunction
- The user interface of the game must be appealing to the player
- The User Experience must be designed in such a way that the player can easily learn the game 
- Patches and bug fixes must be provided after the release of the game


## Needs Assessment  

### Phase I: Explore “What Is”  

### STEP 1: Prepare Management Plan:  
* Project Phases: [Link](https://github.com/Null-References/Uncertainty/blob/Develop/Documentation/Phasing.md)
* Project Schedule: [Link](https://github.com/Null-References/Uncertainty/blob/Develop/Documentation/Project_Scheduling.md)

### STEP 2: Identify Major Concerns:  
Prior to discussing major issues, we need to clarify our goals:  
1. Making a game that people enjoy playing
2. Learning how to develop scalable games using software engineering techniques
3. Acquiring industry recognition 
4. To test our abilities and potential
5. Making Art

We can talk about major concerns now that we know what our goals are:  
1. Project failure - In the absence of proper planning and management, our project could fail and never be completed  
2. Even if the game is finished, it might never get a lot of players due to the insufficiency of it being fun
3. An unreliable software architecture can make the game unscalable 
4. Mismanagement can interfere with decision-making and development 
5. An inferior quality of art and design can devalue a game and make it forgotten


### STEP 3: Determine Need Indicators:  
It is evident from past failures that major concerns are very real and we must handle them carefully  
Games are complicated and they have complex systems, so without a good software architecture they are bound to fail  
To deliver the project on time, time management is essential  


### STEP 4: Consider Data Sources:  
* Youtube
* Unity Forums 
* Google :)
* Any website related to Game development & Software Engineering 


### Phase II: Data Gathering & Analysis

### STEP 1: Determine Target Groups:  
We have found that certain market segments are much more likely to play Uncertainty.  
According to our research, the following characteristics were found in most potential players:  

1. People in the age range of 14 to 25
2. Gamers who are interested in independent games
3. The open-source community 
4. Those who are interested in learning how to make games like this
5. Science-fiction enthusiast
