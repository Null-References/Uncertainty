_We need to clarify something first_   
The game story is not complete, and as a result, some aspects of planning cannot be performed accurately, the story's main characters, for instance, need some work   
the game's mechanics and gameplay are OK, however  
another thing to mention is that ,this document is mainly for demo version and what are we gonna do and how

### 1.  Planning
 - our plan is to make a 3d **Space**, **Shooter** game with **boss fight** mechanics and the reason is these topics are  very popular (for us too)  
 - Our motivation comes from some successful indie games  
  also its fun and challenging to make them  
- our goal is to make a well documented , free and open source , well designed game  
###### Tools and Assets we are gonna use:
- **unity** as engine  
- free assets from unity's asset store and other places  
- **blender** as 3D software (modeling , animation ,etc)  
- **krita** as 2D software (concept arts , etc)   

read about properties of demo in [scenario document](Documentation/SCENARIO.md)   

### 2.  Pre-Production
The purpose of this part of development is to see our game's potential and capabilities.  
also our potential and capabilities :|  
and learning how to manage milestones and how to work properly  
so we test these things as we make a prototype in this phase

### 3.  Production
Production is divided into different parts like management, development, and art  
so we do management as we develop the game so its  more flexible but we try to commit to deadlines and milestones

### 4. Testing
most of the tests are going to be human tests as alpha , beta tests  
but we will use unit tests for very base rules of the game  
### 5. Lunch
lunching for free and open for all parts of the game like codes , art , assets on free  hosting websites like itch
### 6. Post Lunch 
we will fix bugs, keep adding new features after each release
